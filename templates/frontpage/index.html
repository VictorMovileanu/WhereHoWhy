            <h2>Solr</h2>
            <h5>Solr and Elasticsearch</h5>
            <p>
                Why chose one over the other? Which one should I chose? What fits my need best?
                I have found an article today that describes the <a
                    href="https://sematext.com/blog/solr-vs-elasticsearch-differences/">differences between
                Elasticsearch and Solr</a> with satisfying detail. Here are some reasons why Elasticsearch is good:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Easy to use, due to it's JSON API</li>
                <li>Easy to set up</li>
                <li>Caches are rebuilt fast</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first point seems very attractive, since it
                gives you a lot of flexibility in designing your own queries. Solr
                also has a limited JSON API since version 7. I should probably take a look at <a
                        href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_1/json-query-dsl.html">that</a>. Another advantage
                is the availability of
                <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html">a well documented python
                    library</a> for Elasticsearch. Pysolr has None ðŸ˜¡. The advantages of Solr are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Faceting</li>
                <li>Full Text search features</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It seems to me that Solr is a bit more advanced and requires much more expert knowledge, but offering at
                the same time a sick amount of full text search capabilities, also including machine learning which I
                did not mention in my list, since I really can not do anything with it at the moment.</p>
            <p>So TBH, it seems that Solr is maybe a bit too much for the beginning, since I can have a much steeper
                learning curve with Elasticsearch for the beginning... It depends on what I want to use it for. I don't
                know...</p>

            <p>
                This is my playground, where I apply the new skills I learn as a software developer, and note solutions
                to
                problems I solve along the way.

            <h5>refurbish</h5>
            <p>
                My website needs definitely some improvements. First I need some models for my posts and a serious text
                editor such as CKEditor or TinyMCE. Second I have to structure my posts and add a post/update date on
                them. And I finally need to use some SCSS for my styling instead of plain CSS.
            </p>
            <h5>redirect wherehowhy.com to www.wherehowhy.com</h5>
            <p>
                This annoyed me for a long time, but finally I managed to change my nginx settings to redirect from
                wherehowhy.com to www.wherehowhy.com.
